# NDT Client HTTP Replay Generator

## Overview

The HTTP replay generator is an HTTP proxy that saves HTTP request and response
information and processes it so that all requests made during a capture session
can be reproduced with a single web server replaying the replay file.

Specifically, the replay generator:

* Saves the relative URL (path) of each HTTP request and its corresponding
  HTTP response information.
* Replaces all domains found in the traffic with the IP address `127.0.0.1` to
  facilitate local playback.
* Decompresses all gzipped HTTP responses

## Replay file

The generator creates an HTTP replay file, which is a simple YAML file
containing a dictionary or relative URLs mapped to their corresponding HTTP
response information. All response data is decompressed and saved with UTF-8
encoding.

## Domain replacement

The replay generator replaces remote domains with the localhost address to
facilitate local replays. For example, if we capture requests to the following
URLs

* http://foo.com/abc
* http://bar.com/def

The replay generator will create a replay file that allows us to replay the
traffic locally so that the responses are available via a local server like:

* http://127.0.0.1/abc
* http://127.0.0.1/def

To do this, we need to replace references to `href`s to actual domains with
`127.0.0.1` in HTTP response data, so the replay generator processes the
responses to replace these references.

For example a request to http://example.com/welcome with the response:

```html
<html><body><a href="example.com/bar">Go to Bar!</a></body></html>
```
would be saved as:

```html
<html><body><a href="127.0.0.1/bar">Go to Bar!</a></body></html>
```

## Limitations

* Replay generator does not preserve any information about relative ordering of
  requests.
* Replay generator can only save one response per relative URL.
  * If the captured traffic includes requests to different URLs with the same
    relative path (e.g. http://foo.com/abc and http://bar.com/abc) we only save
    the most recent response for a given relative path.
* Replay generator only captures traffic for HTTP `GET` requests.
* Domain replacement is a very na√Øve string replacement
  * Domains may be replaced if they're just text and not actual `href`s
  * We will fail to replace domains if they're constructed dynamically in
    JavaScript, like

      ```javascript
      var url = 'performance' + '.example.com';
      ```

## Example
To capture traffic for an NDT client at
http://www.example.com/foo/ndt:

1. Configure Firefox to use a manually set HTTP proxy at address 127.0.0.1 on
   port 8888.
1. Set Firefox to skip proxy for the following domains:
  * `localhost`
  * `127.0.0.1`
  * `measurement-lab.org` (we don't want to proxy traffic to an M-Lab NDT
    server).
1. Start the replay generator:
    ```bash
    python replay_generator/replay_generator.py \
      --port 8888 \
      --output example.com-replay.yaml
    ```

1. Run Firefox in private mode against the target client URL:
    ```bash
    firefox -private http://www.example.com/foo/ndt
    ```

1. Run the NDT client for a single test until the test is complete.
1. Hit Ctrl+C to stop capturing traffic and save output.

The output file `example.com-replay.yaml` can then be used as the
`--client_path` parameter to `client_wrapper` to replay the HTTP traffic
locally.
