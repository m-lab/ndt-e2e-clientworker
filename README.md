## Pre-Requisites

To install pre-requisites, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Creating an HTTP replay file

For clients that are difficult to host as static files, the operator must use
the `replay_generator.py` script to capture traffic for the client, then use the
replay filename as the `--client_path` parameter to `client_wrapper`. See
replay_generator/README.md for details on generating a replay file.
